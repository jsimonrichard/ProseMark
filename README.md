[ProseMark VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jsimonrichard.vscode-prosemark) | [Demo](https://prosemark.com/demo/)

# ProseMark

**ProseMark** is a modular toolkit for building "What You See Is What You Mean" (WYSIWYM) markdown editors, a type of editor that merges the look of rendered markdown into the editor itself rather than rendering the markdown in a separate window. Two of the most well-known editors of this type are [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and [Typora](https://typora.io/).

This project is structured as a set of extensions for [CodeMirror 6](https://codemirror.net/), and is broken up into the following packages:

- **[`@prosemark/core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@prosemark/core):** the core functionality needed for the WYSIWYM editor.
- **[`@prosemark/render-html`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@prosemark/render-html):** renders blocks of HTML code inside code fences.
- **[`@prosemark/paste-rich-text`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@prosemark/paste-rich-text):** enables pasting formatted rich text into the editor.
