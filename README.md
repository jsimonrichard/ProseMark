# ProseMarkbuilt on top of []Code Mfor buildinghat youYou See Is What You Mean markdowneditors , a type of editor that merges the look of rendered markdown into the editor itself rather than rendering the markdown in a separate window. Two of the most well-known editors of this type are [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and [Typora](https://typora.io/).

- **[`@prosemark/core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@prosemark/core):** the core functionality needed for the WYSIWYM editor.
- **[`@prosemark/render-html`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@prosemark/render-html:** renders blocks of HTML code inside code fences.
- **[`@prosemark/paste-rich-text`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@prosemark/paste-rich-text):** enables pasting formatted rich text into the editor.
